## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Auto Login Settings (Required)

<img src="assets/images/screenshot-1.png" alt="Auto Login Configuration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

Configure these essential settings to enable auto-login functionality:

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Siberian CMS URL | Your Siberian installation URL (with trailing slash) | `https://siberian.example.com/` |
| Connection Type | API (recommended) or Database | API |
| API User | Siberian API username | `admin` |
| API Password | Siberian API password | `********` |
| Auto-Login Button Text | Default label for login buttons | `Access Your App` |

### Database Connection

You may be required to provide database credential to use advanced features like WooCommerce, this is because no SiberianCMS API is available as of yet but hopefully they are working on it, in the meantime, use direct database connection (This is a pro feature)
| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Host | Database server address | `localhost` or `db.example.com` |
| Database Name | Siberian database name | `siberian_cms` |
| Username | Database username | `siberian_user` |
| Password | Database password | `********` |
| Port | Database server port | `3306` (default) |
| Table Prefix | Custom database prefix if used | `sb_` |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Ensure your database user has minimal required permissions. Read-write access to Siberian tables is sufficient.

### Compatibility Settings

The plugin includes a dedicated compatibility tab to address potential conflicts with other Siberian modules:

- **Password Sync Options**: Control how password changes propagate between systems
- **Previewer Compatibility**: Settings to ensure smooth operation with Siberian's Previewer module
- **Legacy Support**: Options for migrating from older integration plugins

### Logging Configuration

<img src="assets/images/screenshot-6.png" alt="Logging Configuration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

## üîß Usage

### Basic Shortcode

Place this shortcode anywhere in your posts or pages to display a standard auto-login button:

```
[swsib_login]
```

### Advanced Shortcode Options

Customize the button appearance and behavior with these parameters:

```
[swsib_login text="Access Your Mobile App" class="large primary" redirect="dashboard" style="outline"]
```

| Parameter | Description | Example Values |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| `text` | Button text | `"Login to App"` |

| `style` | Predefined button style | `"primary"`, `"success"`, `"outline"` |

### Programmatic Usage

Developers can integrate the auto-login functionality directly in theme files:

```php
<?php if (function_exists('swsib_display_login_button')): ?>
    <?php swsib_display_login_button([
        'text' => 'Access Your App',
        'class' => 'custom-button-class',
        'style' => 'primary',
        'redirect' => 'dashboard'
    ]); ?>
<?php endif; ?>
```

## üîí Security Considerations

We prioritize security throughout the plugin's architecture:

- **Secure Authentication**: All credentials are stored securely following WordPress best practices
- **Data Validation**: Thorough input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data

### Security Best Practices

- Regularly update both WordPress and the SwiftSpeed Siberian Integration plugin
- Use strong, unique passwords for API and database access
- Implement proper user role management in both WordPress and Siberian
- Consider IP restrictions for sensitive admin functionalities

1. **Backup**: Create complete backups of both WordPress and Siberian before proceeding
2. **Deactivate Old Plugin**: Disable the existing integration plugin through the WordPress Plugins page
3. **Install SwiftSpeed**: Install and activate SwiftSpeed Siberian Integration
4. **Configure Settings**: Enter your credentials in the Auto Login and Database Connection tabs
5. **Replace Shortcodes**: Update any existing shortcodes in your content (though legacy formats are supported)

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>How does password synchronization work?</strong></summary>
<p>When a user changes their password in WordPress, our plugin securely updates the corresponding record in the Siberian database. This requires the Database Connection to be configured properly. The synchronization is one-way (WordPress ‚Üí Siberian) to maintain security.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is API access required for basic functionality?</strong></summary>
<p>Yes, API access is recommended for auto-login and remote updates. For deeper integration like password synchronization, a direct database connection is required. The API connection offers better security isolation between systems.</p>
</details>

<details>

<p>The plugin requires WordPress 5.0 or higher and PHP 7.4 or higher. We recommend using the latest versions of both for optimal security and performance.</p>
</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the plugin compatible with multisite installations?</strong></summary>
<p>Yes, the plugin supports WordPress multisite installations. Each site can have its own Siberian integration settings, or you can configure network-wide settings.</p>
